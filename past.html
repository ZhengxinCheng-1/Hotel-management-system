			I was born in Chongqing, a city in southwest China.I've been in love with computer games since primary school.
			It was very popular with StarCraft, and I definitely fell in love with him, and his map editor was able to set up maps according to your hobbies, which was my first exposure to programming.
			It can be said that my childhood and the computer are inextricably linked.

				After a little older, the school began to have computer courses, initially mainly to learn word documents and some very basic computer knowledge, 
				at that time also did not have a very careful study, because at that time was only interested in the game.
				It wasn't until I was in high school that I discovered the joys of programming because I read a tutorial on how to write a snake.
				 Then find out that you could write the game yourself.But in China, the high school study pressure is very big, I have little time to learn programming,
				  can only take him as a dream, until the university in the realization.

				After the college entrance examination, I came to Australia to continue my college career, my first university was Macquarie University,
				 my major is software development, I in Macquarie's two years, learned java, c, python and so on. It's also round my high school dream. 
				 In order to improve my self-improvement, this semester, I transferred to the University of Technology, Sydney. During my college years,
				  I also did an internship at Alibaba, in which I mainly do about Alipay coupon management system, 
				this experience for me not only improved my code experience, but also let me know how to use knowledge at work.
